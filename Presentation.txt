Presentation outline, divided into logical blocks, with explanations for each part. 
This is used to guide my video recording and parallel narration:

1. Introduction & Project Overview (2 minutes)
Show:
Solution structure in Visual Studio/VS Code.
The three main entity classes: Blog, Post, Comment.

Explain:
The project is a simple educational blog solution built with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages and Entity Framework using the Repository Design pattern.
Hierarchical structure: Blog ? Post ? Comment with ownership and authorization features.
SQLite database backend with Entity Framework for data persistence.
All requirements focus on authentication, CRUD operations, and ownership management.

2. Data Models & Relationships (1.5 minutes)
Show:
Comment.cs, Post.cs, and Blog.cs model classes.
Entity relationships and foreign key properties.

Explain:
Entity relationships: Blog contains Posts, Posts contain Comments.
OwnerId property for ownership tracking across all entities.
Validation logic (e.g., Content property validation in Comment model).
Navigation properties for Entity Framework relationships.

3. Authentication & Authorization Foundation (2 minutes)
Show:
Login and registration functionality (ASP.NET Core Identity).
Attempt to access create features without login (redirect to login).
Only logged-in users can create blogs, posts, and comments.

Explain:
ASP.NET Core Identity integration for user management.
How authentication restricts access to creation features.
Ownership tracking: The logged-in user becomes the owner of created objects (OwnerId is set to current user).
Authorization requirements for all creation operations.
==============================================================
4. Blog Operations (CR Only) (2 minutes)
Show:
List of all blogs (Blog Index page).
Creating a new blog (show the form and process).
Viewing blog details (shows posts in the blog).

Explain:
Blogs can be created and read only (no edit/delete as per requirements).
Blog ownership assignment to current user.
Each blog can contain multiple posts.
Introduction to Open/Closed status concept.
Parameter passing via GET and POST requests (no sessions used).

5. Post CRUD Operations (3 minutes)
Show:
Viewing posts in a blog.
Creating, editing, and deleting posts (demonstrate forms and actions).
Ownership checks: Only the owner can edit/delete their posts.
Attempting to edit another user's post (authorization failure).
Deleting a post and its comments (cascade delete demonstration).

Explain:
Full CRUD functionality for posts.
Authorization ensures only owners can modify/delete their posts.
Posts are linked to blogs via foreign key relationship.
Repository pattern usage in controller actions.
Parameter passing through form submissions and URL parameters.

6. Comment CRUD & Blog Open/Close Feature (2.5 minutes)
Show:
Viewing comments under a post.
Creating, editing, and deleting comments.
Ownership checks for comments.
Closing a blog and attempting to add post/comment (should be prevented).
Reopening blog to restore functionality.

Explain:
Comments are linked to posts via foreign key relationship.
Only owners can modify/delete their comments.
Blogs can be open or closed to new posts/comments.
The UI and backend enforce this restriction.
Business rule: closed blogs prevent new content creation.

7. Repository Pattern & Architecture (1 minute)
Show:
Repository interface and implementation files.
Dependency injection configuration in Program.cs.

Explain:
How Repository pattern separates data access from business logic.
Dependency injection in Razor Pages and controllers.
Benefits for testing and maintainability.
Clean architecture principles in action.

8. Testing & Test Coverage (1 minute)
Show:
Run unit tests in Visual Studio/Test Explorer.
Display test results and coverage report.

Explain:
Nearly 100% test coverage on controllers and page models.
Test structure using xUnit and Moq for mocking.
How mocking enables isolated testing of business logic.
Tests ensure reliability and correctness of CRUD operations and authorization logic.
Coverage of ownership verification and business rule enforcement.

9. Conclusion (0.5 minutes)
Summarize:
The solution meets all requirements: authentication, CRUD operations, ownership management, open/close functionality, and comprehensive testing.
Repository Design pattern provides clean separation of concerns and maintainability.
Parameter passing exclusively through GET and POST requests (no sessions).
Cascade delete maintains data integrity when removing container objects.
Ready for educational demonstration and real-world extension.

Note: Throughout sections 4-6, emphasize how all data is passed via GET and POST requests with no session usage, demonstrating this with form submissions and URL parameters during the live demonstration.
